## Stage 1 (Setting up of environment for Coding)

### Pre-requisite
1. Set your profile picture.
2. Setup a Git account and learn how to use Git. 
    * Free GitHub private account for the next 1 year. Use this link to redeem: [https://github.com/redeem/hng_ingressive_github](URL), or use the coupon code HNG_INGRESSIVE_GITHUB on your existing github account. Once done, give a shout-out to @GitHubCommunity @GitHubEducation and @_Ingressive_ on Twitter
3. Setup a Figma account. 
    * Figma is the first interface design tool with real-time collaboration. It keeps everyone on the same page. Focus on the work instead of fighting your tools.

    1. Go to [figma.com](URL)
    2. Click Sign Up at the top right side of your screen
    3. Enter your details and Sign Up
    4. Go to your MailBox for a confirmation link which returns you back to your figma profile
    5. Click the + sign at the top left side of your screen to get started
    
4. Download and install Docker. 
    * #### Guide for installing docker on windows Method 1

        Step 1 - Make sure you have Microsoft 64bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education (1607 Anniversary Update, Build 14393 or later).

        Step 2 - Make sure your system supports virtualization and *make sure it is enabled*

        Step 3 - Go to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

        Step 4 - Download the stable version community edition

        Step 5 - Double click on your *Docker for windows installer.exe* file and follow all the prompt the install wizard gives

        Step 6 After docker has been installed locate the docker icon and start up docker

        Step 7 After docker has started, open your terminal and type the command `docker -version` if everything went smoothly it should output the version of docker installed

        Step 8 Run the command `docker run hello-world` then it should build your very first docker container. Once this is successful, you're all set and ready to go

    * #### Guide for installing docker on windows Method 2
        If your system doesn't meet the specifications for installing docker, you can install docker toolbox instead

        *Note* For people whose windows operating system is maybe Windows 10 home or windows 7, or not 1607 Anniversary Update, Build 14393 or later

        Also for people whose system does not support virtualization
        Step 1 - Go to https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

        Step 2 - Download docker toolbox from that link

        Step 3 - Double click on the docker toolbox installer 

        Step 4 - Follow all the prompts in the setup wizard

        Step 5 - After installation is complete, look for the Docker quick start icon and lunch, a bash window should open

        Step 6 - When the bash window is open, once docker starts you should see the docker symbol drawn command line style and most importantly you would see a $ symbol with your keyboard cursor blinking

        Step 7 - To verify your installation, type the command `docker run hello-world` then if that runs successfully, you are set to go
        


5. Get a basic PHP environment working on your system (Hello World).

### Task
To pass stage 1, 
Go to [#stage1](https://hnginternship4.slack.com/messages/CA2DJC5JB)
You will need the following:

1. Design a very simple page in Figma
2. Implement it in html/css (this design should include showing the current time using php)
3. Setup docker
4. Get php to run in docker
4. Make your app work on your local browser
5. Your app must show properly
